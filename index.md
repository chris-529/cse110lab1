## About:
Hey there! My name is Christopher Schrader. I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student studying at **UC San Diego**. Briefly, here are a few things about me:
- I am from **Orange County**, California
- I am **22 years old**
- Some hobbies of mine include hiking and playing video games, namely [Overwatch 2](https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/).
- I have a dog named Jenna, whom I love very much. Here's a [picture](jenna.jpg) of her.

I'm also really into music! I play the piano, guitar, and bass, and love indulging in new sounds. Here's aquote from one of my favorite songs, _Siberian Breaks_ by _MGMT_:
>If you find the soul that you lost
>
>Frozen in a starry void
>
>Take it within and hope the sight of blood
>
>Can will signs of life to return
>
>Back to the way that it was
>
>Long before it made a noise
>
>To keep on quietly reminding you
>
>What's never created or destroyed

My main interest is in web programs, namely _Node.js_ projects, although I do have experience working with other languages and technologies. Here are my favorite languages and frameworks that I have experience in, ranked by how much experience I have in them:
1. HTML/CSS/Javascript
2. Node.js
3. C++ + STL
4. Java
5. SwiftUI

I have about equal experience writing in Javascript and C++, but I tend to prefer C++ slightly. I love the nature of the language in the sense that I have more control over things compared to other higher-level languages such as Javascript. Here is a small code snippet of one of my C++ programs that I used to make a Huffman encoding tree:
```
struct Node {
  std::string huffmanCode;
  std::string value;
  double frequency;
};

class HuffmanTree {
public:
  Node root;
  HuffmanTree* leftSubTree;
  HuffmanTree* rightSubTree;
};
```
